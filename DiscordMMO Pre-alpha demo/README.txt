DiscordMMO is my attempt at trying to make a battle system where multiple people can fight the same monster. I think it's pretty cool. Hopefully there aren't any bugs.


Pretty much all the documentation is contained within each module, but I reccomend taking a look at core.py first, reading through the comments, and then taking a look at the header of bot.py

helpstrings.py also contains all the in-game documentation for every single command.

The module dependency is all a little spaghetti, but at least this isn't a 1400 line long singular python file.
